# This script imports climate predictions downloaded from the
# http://uk-cri.org climate risk indicators, these are based on the
# MET Office HADGEM RCP85 model. They are 12km gridded model
# predictions, and include other higher level risk indicators we might
# be able to make use of in future.

# We import a grid as GEOJSON geometry and the model data each into
# their own tables indexed by grid cell id
